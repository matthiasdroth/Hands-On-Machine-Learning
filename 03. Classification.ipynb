If that score is higher than a certain threshold, the instance is predicted to belong to the \"true\"-class (e.g. \"true, it's a 5\"). If the score is below that threshold, the instance is predicted to belong to the \"false\"-class (\"false, it's not a 5\"). Scikit does not let us set the threshold directly but it grants access to the scores. This way, we can still set a threshold and then classify the instances by means of our own code."

    "Note that \"recall\" is a monotone function while \"precision\" is not! This has to do with the fact that \"recall\" only deals with those instances that are actual 5s. As the threshold increases, the number of actual 5s does not change and the number of those that are classified as 5s can only decrease. Yet \"precision\" deals only with those instances that are predicted to be 5s. As the threshold is increased, the number of predicted 5s will decrease. Every time a \"true positive\" instance drops out while the number of \"false positives\" remains unchanged, the precision will shortly drop (while the overall trend will improve, unless the classifier is really, really bad)."

    "As for precision and recall, there is a tradeoff also for the ROC-curve: the higher the true positive rate the higher is also the false positive rate. This can be understood from the formulas above: the nominators are constant as they represent the number of instances that belong to the positive and negative class, respectively. Lowering the threshold (going to the right in the plot) will increase both ${\\rm TP}$ and ${\\rm FP}$. Still, different algorithm are going to perform differently, i.e., one better than another.\n",
    "<br> Good performance means large TPR at low FPR. Due to the above argument the curve must have a monotone behavior. So a rather straightforward measure for performance will be the area under the curve for the receiver operator curve (\"ROC AUC\"). A perfect classifier will have ${\\rm ROC AUC = 1}$ and a purely random classifier will have ${\\rm ROC AUC = 1/2}$."

    "The \"recall vs. precision\" curve further above and the ROC curve look very similar. The former should be used if the positive class is rare or whenever avoidance of false positives is a priority. Otherwise, the ROC should be used. The reasoning goes as follows:\n",
    "- If the positive class is rare, the negative class will be abundant. In that case, the precision ${\\rm TP/(TP+FP)}$ is a good score since only a good algorithm will avoid classifying a lot of actual negatives as positive. In short, it will be hard to keep ${\\rm FP}$ small and the precision will be large exactly when ${\\rm FP}$ is small compared to ${\\rm TP}$.\n",
    "- In the negative class is small, one should simply exchange the classification labels and, following the above argument, also use the \"recall vs. precision\" curve.\n",
    "- If neither class is small, a good algorithm is expected to keep both ${\\rm FP}$ and ${\\rm FN}$ small at the same time. So the TPR should be large at small FPR. The ROC curve allows to read this off easily."

    "- One possibility to do that is to train 10 binary classes, each of which is dedicated to one out of the 10 classes and outputs a score/probability that the instance belongs to the class. Then an instance will be classified according to the classifier that gives the highest output on that instance. This is called one-versus-all (OvA) multiclass classifcation.\n",
    "- Another possibility is to train N(N-1)/2 binary classifiers, each of which compares a different pair of classes. The class that wins most one-versus-one (OvO) matches will be predicted for that instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "OvA requires N classifiers and thus usually less than OvO, which requires N(N-1)/2 classifiers to be trained. However, OvA requires training on all N classes whereas OvO requires training of each algorithm on only 2 classes. OvA is usually more time-efficient. Yet, if an algorithm scales poorly on larger training sets - and training on all classes implies larger training sets for OvA - OvO might be the better choice.<br>\n",
    "In the following example, ScikitLearn detects that the target set (labels) has N>2 classes and thus automatically runs OvA."

    "Apparently, the columns (i.e. predictions!) for 8s and 9s are quite bright. So there seems to be a lot of misclassification that should be taken care of by improving the classifier for 8s and 9s. Possibly, this could be resolved by counting the number of closed loops per image (1 loop for 9s and 2 loops for 8s. Rows 0 and 1 arerather dark, so no further actions might be required for these. Note that the matrix is not symmetric: more 5s are predicted to be 8s than 8s are predicted to be 5s. Also, 7s tend to be confused with 9s and vice versa. The same also applies for 3s and 5s. These digits mainly differ by the position of the vertical connection in the upper part of the digit: it is on the left for 5s and on the right for 3s. Some digits are drawn at the edge of their square and some seem to be somewhat rotated. So, a possible ansatz is to rotate each image to some conventional direction and to center it within its square. This would likely not only improve the classification of 3s and 5s but of all digits."

    "Using the average assumes that both labels are equally important. Depending on the situation, this might not be appropriate. One rather simple option is to give each label a weight equal to its _support_ (i.e., the number of instances with that target label). This can be achieved by using average=\"weighted\" instead of average=\"macro\" in the above code.\n",
    "## Multioutput Classification\n",
    "page 101<br>\n",
    "Multioutput classification combines multilabel classification and multiclass classification. Now, each label can be a multiclass. This can be illustrated by the 28x28=784 pixels of each MNIST digit. Each pixel has a value between 0 and 255. Each pixel is associated with a label (i.e., 784 labels) and each label is classified into one out of 256 classes, namely the value of the pixel (between 0 and 255).<br><br>\n",
    "Note:<br>\n",
    "The line between classification and regression is sometimes blurry, such as in this example. Arguably, predicting pixel intensity is more akin to regression than to classification. Moreover, multioutput systems are not limited to classification tasks; you could even have a system that outputs multiple labels per instance, including both class labels and value labels.<br><br>\n",
    "In the following, the task is to remove random noise from the MNIST images."
